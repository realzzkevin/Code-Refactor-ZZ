# Code Refactoring

## Goal:


## Issues in the original code:

 - The title of index.html is generic.
 - Not use semantic HTML elements. 
 - Incorrectly use of class attribute.
 -  Redundant CSS selectors and properties in CSS file.
 - CSS file structure isn't follow semantic structure.

## My modifications

 - [x] Change title from "website" to "horiseon" for search engine optimization. 
 - [x] Use sematic elements such as `<header>`,`<footer>`,`<nav>  `etc. to replace most `<div>`elements.
 - [x] Change all unique class attributes to id attributes.
 - [x] Creat new class attributes in html.
 - [x] Add `alt` attributes in all `<img>` elements
 - [x] Consolidat and reorganize CSS selector and properties to follow semantic structure.
